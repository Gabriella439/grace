# A `fold` with an abstract record of handlers will default to treating the
# record as `List` handlers, meaning that the inferred type of this expression
# will be:
#
#       forall (a : Type) (b : Type)
#     . { nil: a, cons: b -> a -> a } -> List b -> a
#
# There are other possible choices, but we default to assuming `List` handlers
# since the `fold` keyword historically is most closely associated with lists,
# even though all supported Grace `fold`s are folds in the more general sense of
# the term:
