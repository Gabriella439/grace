{-| A `Context` is an ordered list of `Entry`s

    Note that this representation stores the `Context` entries in reverse
    order, meaning that the beginning of the list represents the entries that
    were added last.  For example, this context:

    > •, a : Bool, b, c?, d = c?, ➤e : Type

    … corresponds to this Haskell representation:

    > [ MarkerType 4
    > , SolvedType 3 (Monotype.UnsolvedType 2)
    > , UnsolvedType 2
    > , Variable "b"
    > , Annotation "a" (Monotype.Scalar Monotype.Bool)
    > ]

    The ordering matters because the bidirectional type-checking algorithm
    uses ordering of `Context` entries to determine scope.  Specifically:

    * each `Entry` in the `Context` can only refer to variables preceding it
      within the `Context`

    * the bidirectional type-checking algorithm sometimes discards all entries
      in the context past a certain entry to reflect the end of their
      \"lifetime\"
