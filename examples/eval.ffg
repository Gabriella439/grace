# Grace supports "eval", meaning that you can import code from strings (even
# dynamic strings which depend on values in scope) and yet everything is still
# type-checked correctly and the compiler infers that the expression's type is:
#
#     Natural -> Natural

let one = 1

in  import read "\\x -> x + ${show one}"
