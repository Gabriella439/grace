# What do you think this code will do?  Run it to test your guess:
import prompt{ key }
    : { "Job Description": Text } -> { "Is Finance?": Bool, "Rationale": Text }
# You can read the above type as "a function whose input is a record (with a
# "Job Description" field) and whose output is a record (with "Is Finance?" and
# "Rationale" fields)

# The `import` keyword instructs the model to generate Grace code matching the
# expected type.  The generated Grace might use the `prompt` keyword, too!
