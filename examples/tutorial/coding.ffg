# What do you think this code will do?  Run it to test your guess:
prompt{ key, code: true }
    : { jobDescription: Text } -> { isFinance : Bool, rationale : Text }
# You can read the above type as "a function whose input is a record (with a
# `jobDescription` field) and whose output is a record (with `isFinance` and
# `rationale` fields)

# The `code: true` argument instructs the model to generate Grace code matching
# the expected type.  The generated Grace might use the `prompt` keyword, too!
# Be sure to check out the "Code" tab to see what code the model generated
